-  Conducted initial analysis to understand the data structure and key metrics.
-  Formulated specific questions to guide the analysis, such as identifying top-performing coffee types, customer preferences, and regional trends.

- Created pivot tables to analyze:
- Bike purchases by region, gender, and marital status.
- Commute distance and its impact on bike purchases.
- Age brackets and income ranges of bike purchasers.

## Insights

1. Regional Analysis
- Highest Sales: North America had the highest number of bike purchases, followed by Europe and Asia Pacific.
- Gender Influence: In Asia Pacific, fewer females purchased bikes (30%) compared to Europe (50%) and North America (45%).
- Recommendation: Launch targeted marketing campaigns in Asia Pacific to engage female customers, such as promotions or female-centric bike designs.

2. Income and Occupation
- Income Range: Customers with an income range of the highest bike purchase rates are observed in the 10K-40K (43%) and 50K-80K (41%) income ranges, indicating strong demand in these middle-income segments.
- Occupation: Professionals and manual workers showed higher bike purchase rates compared to other occupations.
- Recommendation: Tailor marketing messages to these income groups and occupations, emphasizing affordability and utility.
3. Commute Distance
- Customers with a commute distance of less than 2 miles were more likely to purchase bikes.
- Recommendation: Promote bikes as an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution for short commutes.

4. Age and Family Size
- Age Group: The 36–45 age group had the highest bike purchase rate.
- Family Size: Families with more than 2 children were less likely to purchase bikes.
- Recommendation: Offer family-friendly bike models or discounts for larger families to increase sales in this segment.

5. Car and Home Ownership
- Car Ownership: Customers owning fewer than 1 car were more likely to purchase bikes.
- Home Ownership: Homeowners were more likely to purchase bikes compared to renters.Could this be linked to storage space availability? If so, a recommendation on foldable or compact bikes might be useful.
- Recommendation: Introduce financing options or promotions for renters and non-car owners to make bikes more accessible.
